## Working of the project

 It is a UI based real time currency converter which converts the value of one currency to another by using the API which helps the program to take the real time rates of the currency to be converted. Here we imported tkinter  module for designing UI and requests module (**allows you to send HTTP requests**) for receiving and using  API calls.We have also given a info button for those who don't know the currency codes.
Our converter supports 10 currencies.They are :  
- USD
- INR
- EUR
- JPY
- CAD
- AUD
- YER
- NZD
- CUP
- KRW
